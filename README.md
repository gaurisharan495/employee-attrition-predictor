# Employee Attrition Predictor

A machine learning model that predicts employee attrition (whether an employee is likely to leave the company) based on key HR and performance factors.  
Developed during my internship at OnActuate Consulting.

## Project Overview
The project helps HR teams proactively identify employees at risk of leaving the organization.  
It leverages data-driven insights to support employee retention strategies and resource planning.

## Features
•⁠  ⁠Predicts employee attrition probability using machine learning  
•⁠  ⁠Data preprocessing and feature engineering for HR datasets  
•⁠  ⁠Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
•⁠  ⁠Interactive visualization of important features  
•⁠  ⁠Exportable prediction results and model insights  

## Tech Stack
•⁠  ⁠*Programming Language:* Python  
•⁠  ⁠*Libraries & Tools:* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, CatBoost  
•⁠  ⁠*Notebook Environment:* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

## Dataset
•⁠  ⁠*Source:* HR Analytics Dataset (synthetic / anonymized)  
•⁠  ⁠*Features:* Age, Job Role, Monthly Income, Years at Company, Overtime, etc.  
•⁠  ⁠*Target Variable:* ⁠ Attrition ⁠ (Yes / No)

## How to Run
1.⁠ ⁠Clone the repository.
2.⁠ ⁠Install required Python libraries (⁠ pip install -r requirements.txt ⁠).
3.⁠ ⁠Open the Jupyter Notebook (⁠ employee_attrition_model.ipynb ⁠) to explore the code and results.
